The First Keylogger in History  

    One of the first keyloggers in the world appeared during the Cold War. Soviet spies were monitoring American diplomats using a bug hidden inside IBM Selectric typewriters. These devices were embedded in 16 typewriters used from 1976 to 1984 at the U.S. embassies in Moscow and Leningrad. 

    The principle of the bug's operation was based on the movement of the typewriter's print head. To type a character, the print head had to rotate in a specific direction unique to each symbol on the keyboard. The mechanism captured the energy from the magnetic field generated by the carriage's movement and converted it into a digital signal. Each received signal was stored on the bug as a four-bit character. The device could store up to eight such characters, after which it transmitted them to Soviet spies (the transmission occurred via radio frequencies to a nearby listening station).

    Detecting the bug was a non-trivial task even for American intelligence agencies. It could be spotted using X-ray imaging, but it didn’t emit a strong radio signal since it often broadcasted on frequencies used by American TV. Additionally, tracking some advanced versions of the bug via a radio signal was only possible if the typewriter was turned on, the keylogger was activated, and the spy device analyzer was tuned to the correct frequency. A trained Soviet technician could install such a bug in an IBM Selectric in just half an hour. 

    According to Ars Technica, the bugs went undetected for eight years, and the Americans only learned about them thanks to a report from one of the U.S.’s allies, whose intelligence services discovered similar surveillance at one of their own embassies.
