The First Keylogger in History  
1
    One of the first keyloggers in the world appeared during the Cold War. Soviet spies were monitoring American diplomats using a bug hidden inside IBM Selectric typewriters. These devices were embedded in 16 typewriters used from 1976 to 1984 at the U.S. embassies in Moscow and Leningrad. 

    According to Ars Technica, the bugs went undetected for eight years, and the Americans only learned about them thanks to a report from one of the U.S.â€™s allies, whose intelligence services discovered similar surveillance at one of their own embassies. 
    On October 12, 2015, this story was recounted by Bruce Schneier, a member of the board of directors of the International Association for Cryptologic Research.
